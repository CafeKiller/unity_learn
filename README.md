# Warehouse Description

This is a personal backup repository, mainly for documenting my code and scripts as I learn Unity.  

Unity projects have a lot of very large resource files that aren't suitable for Git, and I usually put them on a disk;    
So the code in this repository is not suitable for anyone to learn or use, if there are parts of the code that you can use, it is recommended to copy them directly.
